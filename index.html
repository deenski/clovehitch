				<h1 id="title">Clove Hitch</h1>
	      <p><b>From Wikipedia:</b> The clove hitch is a type of knot. Along with the bowline and the sheet bend, it is often considered one of the most important knots and is commonly referred to as a Double Hitch.[1] A clove hitch is two successive half-hitches around an object. It is most effectively used as a crossing knot. It can be used as a binding knot, but is not particularly secure in that role.[2] A clove hitch made around the rope's own standing part is known as either two half-hitches or buntline hitch, depending on whether the turns of the clove hitch progress away from or towards the hitched object. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clove_hitch">Read More on Wikiepedia</a></p>
